# W3C TPAC Sustainable Web Guidelines Breakout Discussion
Slides to guide the 2025 TPAC breakout group — [Sustainable Web IG Update for the Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/events/meetings/f7fcc7e0-49fc-4636-bd06-9f31babc0352/). 
12 November 2025, 08:30–09:30 Japan Standard Time

## Description  
The web is critical infrastructure, but its environmental and social impacts are growing: energy use, e-waste, and inefficiency at global scale. W3C has championed accessibility and privacy as pillars of a trustworthy web—sustainability needs the same attention.

The Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG) Community Group initially drafted guidelines, modeled on WCAG, that offers practical, testable steps for reducing the footprint of web technologies. Since then, the Industry group has substantially revised this. We are now seeking a wide review. This breakout will share updates and solicit feedback about implementability, organizational structure, and adoption.

Key discussion points:
- How to incorporate sustainability alongside accessibility and privacy, performance
- How to ensure testability / measure-ability and avoid greenwashing
- Opportunities to highlight integrations with other standards
- Next steps: pilots, adoption paths, and potential W3C involvement
